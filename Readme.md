## Extensions ##
### Comment Formatter ###

Download: **[Official VSIX Package (Current Release)](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/66521234-bd62-4e52-95a4-2ddbb225d081/file/180099/1/CommentFormatter.vsix "CommentFormatter.vsix")**

The **Comment Formatter** extension provides additional formatting behavior for source code comments. The most prominent feature is the support for italicization, which can be configured for both normal and documentation comments individually.

Another feature is fading out of documentation tags. When enabled, all tags within a documentation comment will be displayed semitransparent instead of opaque, which makes them less obtrusive and turns the focus back on the content.
